Using GridCal as a library
==========================

You can use the calculation engine directly or from other applications:

.. code:: ipython3

    from GridCal.Engine import *

This will provide access to all the objects in the internal engine of **GridCal**.
Refer to the :ref:`API Reference<api>` and the :ref:`examples` for more details.

Power systems scripting
-----------------------

GridCal is a Python library for power systems simulation. As such you can seamlessly use
the graphical user interface (GUI) or use GridCal as a library to program your
own software. Using GridCal as a library might be useful when automatizing tasks or when
you need to build a custom study or new tool.
