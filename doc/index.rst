Welcome to GridCal's documentation!
===================================

**GridCal** (abbreviation of Grid Calculator) is a power
systems software that has been used for research and power systems
consultancy since 2015.

GridCal aims at being a fully usable software product by end users, while allowing
power users to tweak it and extend it at will. GridCal is designed as a software
library with a graphical user interface, and because of this you can use
GridCal as a conventional software, or you may embed it into your own programs.
