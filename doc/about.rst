About GridCal
================

**GridCal** is a research oriented power systems software.

Research oriented? How? Well, it is a fruit of research. It is designed to be modular.
As a researcher I found that the available software (not even talking about commercial
options) are hard to expand or adapt to achieve complex simulations. **GridCal** is
designed to allow you to build and reuse modules, which eventually will boost your
productivity and the possibilities that are at hand.

I have made other projects (even another open source one: fPotencia in C++). I believe
that this project encapsulates my half life of programming experience and the curiosity
I have developed for power systems.

So, I do really hope you enjoy it, and if you have comments, suggestions or just want
to collaborate, do not hesitate to contact.

Cheers,

Santiago
